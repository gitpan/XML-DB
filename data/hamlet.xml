<LINE>Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;</LINE>
<LINE>And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:</LINE>
<LINE>A villain kills my father; and for that,</LINE>
<LINE>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</LINE>
<LINE>To heaven.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POLONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>He took my father grossly, full of bread;</LINE>
<LINE>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</LINE>
<LINE>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?</LINE>
<LINE>But in our circumstance and course of thought,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,</LINE>
<LINE>To take him in the purging of his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>When he is fit and season'd for his passage?</LINE>
<LINE>No!</LINE>

<LINE>Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:</LINE>
<LINE>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;</LINE>
<LINE>At gaming, swearing, or about some act</LINE>
<LINE>That has no relish of salvation in't;</LINE>
<LINE>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his soul may be as damn'd and black</LINE>
<LINE>As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:</LINE>
<LINE>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</LINE>

--WARNING The current version works with eXist 0.9 (though the 'createId'
function is still not available; this will show as a failure in the tests),
and Xindice 1.0, aka 'birthday'. It will almost certainly fail to work
with Xindice 1.1, when that's released, though a new driver may eventually
be written for Xindice 1.1
--


This is a perl implementation of the XML:DB API (http://www.xmldb.org).
It should pass 100% of its own tests with Xindice, and 95% with eXist. 
See BUGS for more details. There's also a simple file driver, which is extremely
slow, but gives a consistent interface for things like copying from files
to a real database.

This package currently implements most of the core XML:DB API, though some
parts are just stubs. XUPDate is implemented for eXist and File (which dont 
have a native version), and Xindice (which does)! This also means that you
only get a kind of lowest common denominator to the dbs - non-standard, db
specific functions are not implemented (though they could be).

Error handling is awful, and will be improved. 

Performance will never be good - this is a front end to XML-RPC implementations,
which has to duplicate a lot of what's already going on the other side of
the XML-RPC connection. For good performance we'll need a C/Perl backend
written... The File driver may grow up to be this one day.

There will be a more complete README when this is all more stable.

Ohhh... to install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

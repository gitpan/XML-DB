General
-------

1.perl Makefile.PL doesn't notice test.pl file, so make test tries to
call t/* files directly. FIXED IN THIS VERSION

2. No proper support for anything other than ASCII :-( This is certainly
fixable, but hasn't been fixed yet.

XML::XUpdate::LibXML
--------------------

1.XML::XUpdate::LibXML returns
Can't locate object method "append" via package "XML::LibXML::Element" at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/XML/XUpdate/LibXML.pm line 132, <IN> line 92.
- solution: upgrade your XML::XUPdate::LibXML to the latest version.


Xindice (1.0)
-------------

1. Xindice won't upload full hamlet.xml; gives
RPC::XML::Client:send_request: HTTP server error: EOF" at lib/XML/SimpleDB/Database/Xindice.pm line 251
(driven from RPC::XML::request->new('db.insertDocument', $collectionName, $id, $content);
Fix: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xindice-dev&m=102149898512882&w=2

1b. Having applied fix above, now dies with:
Fatal error parsing XML: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: unexpected end of file found
(the file can be loaded from the command line, so it isnt a problem with the file itself).

2. Xindice's setDocument doesn't seem to do anything.

eXist 0.8
-------------

1. Hangs up with no threads available after creating server collections.
Fix: http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/8389/0/8925237/

2. Fails to understand // as part of a valid XPath when applied to the
top-level node in a collection  (eg if collection contains only <node>hi</node>
collection(/colname)//node returns nothing). It should be self-or-descendant,
shouldn't it? Certainly different behaviour from Xindice. Check this again -
may have been due to me not removing <result> wrapper...

3. CreateId is not yet included in the standard exist distribution.

eXist 0.9
---------

CreateId is not yet included in the standard exist distribution.

Other
-----

If using XML::RPC with Apache, and xml-rpc calls mysteriously vanish, try
reverting to XML::Parser 2.29 (see note in XML:RPC directory).

For RPC::XML, if 2 mysterious trailing characters being added to xml being
saved, change line 487 of XML.pm to:
MIME::Base64::encode_base64($$self, '')


Differences between Exist and Xindice
-------------------------------------

Exist will treat /db as the root collection; Xindice doesn't see it as a 
collection. So there is no way to see the top-level collections using
listChildCollections over XML:RPC?
